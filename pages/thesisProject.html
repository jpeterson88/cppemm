		Students in the Educational Multimedia program start exploring different ideas for their MA thesis or project early on in
		the program while taking courses in theoretical foundations of multimedia production. Project is the choice of majority
		of students, allowing them to showcase their knowledge and competencies by creating an interactive multimedia learning
		software. Some students choose to explore an issue or a topic through independent research trying to make a contribution
		to knowledge. For more detailed information about Master's thesis/project regulations, visit the following site: https://www.cpp.edu/~academic-programs/graduate-studies/index.shtml
		eSymposium Educational Multimedia Students are invited to present their thesis projects at the eSymposium held each spring.
		In addition to the virtual meeting space, the eSymposium page contains links to recordings of past symposia presentations.

		by Y. Kyla Hjertstedt, 2012 The purpose of this project was to create an entry level, web-based, religious studies learning
		tool for self-directed adult learners interested in increasing their religious literacy. Most of the United States and
		world is divided by lines of culture and religion yet most Americans know little about the similarities and differences
		which define these divides. Many academics argue that religious literacy is necessary for domestic and global tranquility
		and that the recent influx of religious diversity in the United States requires all Americans, regardless of formal education
		levels, become religiously literate. Web-based learning is an excellent vehicle for adult, post-secondary, non-collegiate
		religious studies education. Combine the effectiveness of web based education, the prevalence of adult online learners,
		and the documented need for improved religious literacy, and the usefulness of a web based religious studies resources
		becomes apparent. The self-directed and non-compulsory nature of this project led to the development of an asynchronous
		learning model which utilized multimedia learning theory, multiple intelligence theory, and adult learning theory. Learner
		feedback indicated that this project effectively increased users' understanding of religion. Respondents overwhelmingly
		reported satisfaction with the content, structure, and aesthetics of the site. Most felt that they left the site better
		informed than when they arrived. In addition, most respondents reported that they would recommend the site to others looking
		to improve their religious literacy. An Interactive Bullying Prevention Website for Fifth Grade Students by Lacey Lloyd,
		2012 Bullying is a serious problem in schools throughout the United States that is only recently starting to gain more
		attention. It is an issue that begins in elementary school and continues through the grade levels. Effective solutions
		are needed for school officials in order to help remedy this growing problem. The purpose of this project is to provide
		students with an interactive website that can be accessed to learn more about the topic of bullying. Through the site,
		students are able to learn what bullying is and the proper solutions to a variety of bullying situations that they may
		encounter at school. By doing so, the goal is to provide students with a place they can go to educate themselves about
		bullying if they have any questions and do not know what to do. This website also provides children with help in developing
		necessary social skills that they need while learning about the topic of bullying. They learn how to use problem-solving
		skills and conflict-resolution skills to resolve different bullying situations that they may face. uTeach by Lindsay Boyer,
		2012 This project researched the integration of mobile technologies, specifically those with the capability to run mobile
		applications, into mathematics education at the elementary school level. The project served two main purposes; first it
		served as a professional development tutorial for elementary school teachers that provided specific justification for the
		use of mobile technologies in the classroom, information about the benefits and support for technology integration as well
		as specific integration strategies being used by other educators in classrooms. The project also served as an example of
		an interactive book created using iBooks Author released by Apple in January 2012. AS3 Intern by Erick Zelaya, 2012 The
		evolution of technology into more sophisticated mobile devices has had an impact on the demand for distance learning. This
		project was a mobile application, for Android and iOS devices, that applied pedagogical theory to teach Actionscript 3.0.
		The methodology used was based on the psychology of worked examples, as these are powerful methods of cognition. Based
		on this method, the application provided a large number of Actionscript code examples followed by detailed explanations
		of each piece of code. The application also provided working examples of what the code actually looked like when compiled
		so that the user could see the examples run directly on their mobile devices. The Adobe® Flex framework was used to leverage
		existing skills to develop an application that would run across different devices without having to invest in developing
		in multiple languages. This helped in resolving issues having to do with the cost of developing for multiple devices in
		multiple languages. The ability to access the application through mobile devices was convenient and supportive of learning
		the content. According to those who participated in the survey, the delivery method of the content was effective for learning
		Actionscript 3.0 and augmented the learning considerably. The application can be installed through the Google Play Store
		and iTunes App Store at: For Android devices: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.erickzelaya.mobile.AS3Intern
		For iOS devices: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/as3-intern/id529433508?ls=1&mt=8
