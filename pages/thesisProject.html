		Master’s Thesis Project
	</h1>
	<p>Students in the Educational Multimedia program start exploring different ideas for their MA thesis or project early on in the program while taking courses in theoretical foundations of multimedia production. Project is the choice of majority of students, allowing them to showcase their knowledge and competencies by creating an interactive multimedia learning software. Some students choose to explore an issue or a topic through independent research trying to make a contribution to knowledge.

<p>The purpose of this project was to create an entry level, web-based, religious studies learning tool for self-directed adult learners interested in increasing their religious literacy. Most of the United States and world is divided by lines of culture and religion yet most Americans know little about the similarities and differences which define these divides. Many academics argue that religious literacy is necessary for domestic and global tranquility and that the recent influx of religious diversity in the United States requires all Americans, regardless of formal education levels, become religiously literate. Web-based learning is an excellent vehicle for adult, post-secondary, non-collegiate religious studies education. Combine the effectiveness of web based education, the prevalence of adult online learners, and the documented need for improved religious literacy, and the usefulness of a web based religious studies resources becomes apparent. The self-directed and non-compulsory nature of this project led to the development of an asynchronous learning model which utilized multimedia learning theory, multiple intelligence theory, and adult learning theory. Learner feedback indicated that this project effectively increased users' understanding of religion. Respondents overwhelmingly reported satisfaction with the content, structure, and aesthetics of the site. Most felt that they left the site better informed than when they arrived. In addition, most respondents reported that they would recommend the site to others looking to improve their religious literacy.</p>

<p>Bullying is a serious problem in schools throughout the United States that is only recently starting to gain more attention. It is an issue that begins in elementary school and continues through the grade levels. Effective solutions are needed for school officials in order to help remedy this growing problem.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to provide students with an interactive website that can be accessed to learn more about the topic of bullying. Through the site, students are able to learn what bullying is and the proper solutions to a variety of bullying situations that they may encounter at school. By doing so, the goal is to provide students with a place they can go to educate themselves about bullying if they have any questions and do not know what to do. This website also provides children with help in developing necessary social skills that they need while learning about the topic of bullying. They learn how to use problem-solving skills and conflict-resolution skills to resolve different bullying situations that they may face.

<p>This project researched the integration of mobile technologies, specifically those with the capability to run mobile applications, into mathematics education at the elementary school level. The project served two main purposes; first it served as a professional development tutorial for elementary school teachers that provided specific justification for the use of mobile technologies in the classroom, information about the benefits and support for technology integration as well as specific integration strategies being used by other educators in classrooms. The project also served as an example of an interactive book created using iBooks Author released by Apple in January 2012.</p>

<p>The evolution of technology into more sophisticated mobile devices has had an impact on the demand for distance learning. This project was a mobile application, for Android and iOS devices, that applied pedagogical theory to teach Actionscript 3.0. The methodology used was based on the psychology of worked examples, as these are powerful methods of cognition. Based on this method, the application provided a large number of Actionscript code examples followed by detailed explanations of each piece of code. The application also provided working examples of what the code actually looked like when compiled so that the user could see the examples run directly on their mobile devices.</p>

<p>The Adobe® Flex framework was used to leverage existing skills to develop an application that would run across different devices without having to invest in developing in multiple languages. This helped in resolving issues having to do with the cost of developing for multiple devices in multiple languages. The ability to access the application through mobile devices was convenient and supportive of learning the content. According to those who participated in the survey, the delivery method of the content was effective for learning Actionscript 3.0 and augmented the learning considerably. The application can be installed through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.erickzelaya.mobile.AS3Intern">Google Play Store for Android devices</a> and the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/as3-intern/id529433508?ls=1&mt=8">iTunes App Store for iOS devices</a>.
